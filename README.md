This porject is a portfolio for my graphic designs. It includes many mooboards, a few logos, and a few posters I have created. I had previously made this via adobe illustrate, and for this assignment I was instructed to recreate it in HTML 5 format. 

The process was pretty straightforward, beginning with backgrounds and text sizing, to adding in the images and centering everything where I needed it to be. I'd say the coloring was the most enjoyable process for me.

What is working well:
The Mobile as well as the desktop versions are both working well, and everything is spaced well and organized (with help lol).

What is incomplete:
There were little embellishement details I had added in Adobe illustrate, but I wasn't sure how to put those into my portfolio with HTML.
